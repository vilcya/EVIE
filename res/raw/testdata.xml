    <name>TSA General Body Meeting</name>
    <description>When it comes down to it, TSA is simply a group of students who come together to have fun with each other and to participate in all the cool things CMU has to offer. Our activities can be as small as getting late-night together or as involved as building booth for the annual CMU spring carnival. We are a non-exclusive org; in fact, more than half our members aren't of Taiwanese descent! Please check us out during orientation week and over the course of the school year. We're excited to meet you!
    
    Come find out more about the members of the Taiwanese Students Organization and the org itself at Monday's general body meeting! </description>

    <name>SCS4ALL Meeting</name>
    <description>A SCS wide, graduate and undergraduate organization working to promote diversity in the School of Computer Science and to broaden interest, understanding and diversity in computing fields through outreach. 
    
    The SCS4ALL advisory council is a new umbrella organization that works to develop a program of social and professional activities and leadership opportunities to broaden interest and participation in computing by underrepresented groups including women, minorities, students and teachers in K-12, and others who may feel isolated or left out.

SCS4ALL is open to all students in the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science (SCS) as well as any friends of SCS4ALL. We want ALL communities in SCS to feel included in shaping the organization and the events we run.

We hope to have lots of opportunities for Outreach. Students who are interested in reaching out can come to our biweekly General Meetings.</description>

    <name>Study Abroad Information Session</name>
    <description>With advance planning, OIE study abroad staff will conduct study abroad information sessions targeted to a particular group of students.  This allows the study abroad advisor to be specific (1) by major regarding the best time for study abroad and (2) about top overseas universities and programs for curricular fit.   Several departments are active in supporting study abroad initiatives through such sessions including architecture and art, biology, chemistry and physics, the CIT first-year seminar and others.  These sessions are most effective in conjunction with a supportive faculty member from the department and/or returned study abroad students from the same major or discipline.  Sophomore seminar classes are an ideal setting for such a session.

    <name>Origami Rose Sales</name>
    <description>Origami (from ori meaning "folding", and kami meaning "paper" (kami changes to gami due to rendaku) is the traditional Japanese art of paper folding, which started in the 17th century AD at the latest and was popularized outside of Japan in the mid-1900s. It has since then evolved into a modern art form. The goal of this art is to transform a flat sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques, and as such the use of cuts or glue are not considered to be origami. Paper cutting and gluing is usually considered kirigami.

    <name>Palantir Tech Talk</name>
    <description>Palantir Technologies is working to radically change how groups analyze information. We were founded in 2004 by a handful of PayPal alumni and Stanford computer scientists. Since then we've doubled in size every year while retaining our early-stage values: a startup culture, strong work ethic and rigorous hiring standards. 
    
    We currently offer a suite of software applications for integrating, visualizing and analyzing the world's information. We support many kinds of data including structured, unstructured, relational, temporal and geospatial.

Our products are built for real analysis with a focus on security, scalability, ease of use and collaboration. They are broadly deployed in the intelligence, defense, law enforcement and financial communities, and are spreading rapidly by word of mouth into applications in other industries and realms of impact.

Palantir is headquartered in downtown Palo Alto, CA, with offices around the world. The contents of this tech talk are TBA. Check your email for updates!</description>

    <description>In 1980 the black Falashas in Ethiopia are recognised as genuine Jews. In turn they are secretly carried to Israel. The day before the transport the son of a Jewish mother dies. In his place and with his name (Schlomo) she takes a Christian 9-year-old boy. Upon arrival this second mother dies. Schlomo is adopted by a good family but remains depressed until he secretly sends a letter to his real mother. From the beginning he experiences large and small racist difficulties. In his teens he and Sarah fall in love. Her father is an extreme racist. Schlomo tries to gain "real Jewishness" by winning a competition in Bible interpretation. No change of Sarah's father's attitude. Disappointed he goes to the police and reports himself as not being a Jew. But the police officer just gives him a scolding. "The newspapers are full of that stuff, the Falashas are no Jews. Now they begin to believe it themselves." His adoptive parents send him to France to study medicine. When he afterwards marries Sarah she loses her family and her status as a "white Jew". But he dares not tell her the truth until she becomes pregnant. She leaves him, but only because he had not trusted that she would love him as much anyway. His adoptive mother reconciles them. Sarah's first line when she returns: "Unbelievable what three mothers would do for you." But she makes a condition for returning: Schlomo must meet his real mother again. As a doctor he takes a job in the Ethiopian fugitive camp where she is still alive.

    <name>SCS4ALL Undergrad Pre-registration Event</name>
    <description>The SCS4ALL advisory council is a new umbrella organization that works to develop a program of social and professional activities and leadership opportunities to broaden interest and participation in computing by underrepresented groups including women, minorities, students and teachers in K-12, and others who may feel isolated or left out.

SCS4ALL is open to all students in the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science (SCS) as well as any friends of SCS4ALL. We want ALL communities in SCS to feel included in shaping the organization and the events we run.

We hope to have lots of opportunities for Outreach. Students who are interested in reaching out can come to our biweekly General Meetings. Undergrad Pre-registration Event</description>

    <summary>A SCS wide, graduate and undergraduate organization working to promote diversity in the School of Computer Science and to broaden interest, understanding and diversity in computing fields through outreach. 
    
    The SCS4ALL advisory council is a new umbrella organization that works to develop a program of social and professional activities and leadership opportunities to broaden interest and participation in computing by underrepresented groups including women, minorities, students and teachers in K-12, and others who may feel isolated or left out.

SCS4ALL is open to all students in the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science (SCS) as well as any friends of SCS4ALL. We want ALL communities in SCS to feel included in shaping the organization and the events we run.

We hope to have lots of opportunities for Outreach. Students who are interested in reaching out can come to our biweekly General Meetings.</summary>

    <description>The SCS4ALL advisory council is a new umbrella organization that works to develop a program of social and professional activities and leadership opportunities to broaden interest and participation in computing by underrepresented groups including women, minorities, students and teachers in K-12, and others who may feel isolated or left out.

SCS4ALL is open to all students in the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science (SCS) as well as any friends of SCS4ALL. We want ALL communities in SCS to feel included in shaping the organization and the events we run.

We hope to have lots of opportunities for Outreach. Students who are interested in reaching out can come to our biweekly General Meetings </description>

    <name>SCS4ALL Meeting</name>
    <description>The SCS4ALL advisory council is a new umbrella organization that works to develop a program of social and professional activities and leadership opportunities to broaden interest and participation in computing by underrepresented groups including women, minorities, students and teachers in K-12, and others who may feel isolated or left out.

SCS4ALL is open to all students in the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science (SCS) as well as any friends of SCS4ALL. We want ALL communities in SCS to feel included in shaping the organization and the events we run.

We hope to have lots of opportunities for Outreach. Students who are interested in reaching out can come to our biweekly General Meetings  An SCS Event</description>

    <name>Hack+ Finale</name>
    <description>Hack+ is a semester long hackathon, and you will be given resources and mentors to help you produce those awesome application ideas. What you receive from it is equivalent to what you dedicate. This means you set your own pace, your own time, and develop your own ideas. You can meet with your team weekly, monthly, or even finish your project during your own 24-hour hackathon!
 
 Some time to finish up and then it all ends :( Be prepared to dazzle all with the culmination of your semester's work and admire the work of others. There will be judges, prizes, and fun!</description>

    <description>Despite the ultimate goal of building a really cool, useful product, hackathons tend to only draw the students who already have the technical skills necessary to build a cool product. But the hardest part of a hackathon can be coming up with an idea, finding people to work with, or getting the data you need to create a great app.

TartanHacks tries to solve those problems. Instead of 24 hours of coders trying to find an idea, Tartanhacks is 24 hours of ideas that are just itching to be written into code. Check in for TartanHacks. You must be registered to check in!</description>
